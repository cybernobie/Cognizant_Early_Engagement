# Substitution Cipher Technique

Ava sitting in the first row wants to send a secret message to her friend Mia who is sitting in the last row. She wrote a secret message in a piece of paper and passed it through her classmates. Ava has used a substitution cipher technique where every letter is replaced with the 7th alphabet before the letter in the alphabet series. Since Mia already knows the technique she easily got the exact message.

The encrypted text (input) may have numbers or special characters along with letters. If so, ignore those and convert only the letters. If space occurs between the words of input, it must occur in output also. If no letters, then there is `“No hidden message”`.

Develop a java application that accepts the secret message to decrypt and print the actual message to the screen. Input consists of the encrypted text.
