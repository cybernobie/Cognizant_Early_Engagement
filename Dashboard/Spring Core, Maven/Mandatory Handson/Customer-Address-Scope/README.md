# Customer-Address-Scope

ZEE Department Store wanted to develop a spring application for sending the weekly offers for their customers. As part of it, every customer along with his/her address needs to be updated in the system. Partial code for the same is provided. The problem which developers were facing is that, every time a customer object is updated with the address, it gets reflected for the other customers also.

Make the necessary changes in the XML Configuration file,so that every time a new customer object and a new address object needs to be created.

{Hint: Use the appropriate Scope in the xml file}

## Design Constraints:

The className/Attribute Name/PackageName should be same as specified in the problem statement. Do not create any new packages.
